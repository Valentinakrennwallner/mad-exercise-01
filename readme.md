## Questions
### Describe how Kotlin handles null safety. What are nullable types and non-null types in Kotlin? (0,5 points)



> Note: you can also use code snippets to illustrate your answer. 

Kotlin is generally characterised by its null safety, which means that null values are not permitted. Non-null types are set by default in Kotlin. 
If a variable should nevertheless be able to assume the value zero, this must be explicitly specified by adding a question mark ('?') after the data type. 
In the case of such a nullable variable, the question mark ('?') can be used again to ensure null security. 
It is also possible to make an explicit non-zero assumption with the exclamation mark ('!!').

```kotlin 
// example code snippet
val a: String = "value" // non-null type
val address: String? = null // nullable type 
val uppercaseName: String = name!!.uppercase() // Safe here because name is non-nullable
```

### What are lambda expressions and higher order functions in Kotlin? Why would you store a function inside a variable? (0,5 points)

A lambda function essentially acts as an object, which allows it to be assigned to a variable. 
Functions of higher order accept lambda expressions as parameters. 
Storing a function within a variable proves beneficial for enhancing reuse or for implementing callback mechanisms.
### Provide a solution for the following number guessing game inside `App.kt`. (3 points)

## Number Guessing Game in Kotlin
The game is a simple number guessing game. The task is to generate a random, max 9-digit, number. The number must **not contain repeating digits**. Valid digits are 1-9.
Ask the user to guess the max 9-digit number. The game is finished when the user guesses the correct digits in the correct order.
In each round, the user gets feedback about the number of correct digits and the number of correct digits in the correct position.
The output should be in the format "n:m", where "n" is the number of digits guessed correctly regardless of their position, 
and "m" is the number of digits guessed correctly at their correct position. Here are some examples:

This example shows the game flow with 4-digits to guess (the default argument)

Generated number: 8576
-	User input: 1234, Output: 0:0
-	User input: 5678, Output: 4:1
-	User input: 5555, Output: 1:1
-	User input: 3586, Output: 3:2
-	User input: 8576, Output: 4:4 -> user wins

Take a look into the provided code structure in `src/main/kotlin/App.kt`. Implement the following methods (lambda expressions):
- _playNumberGame(digitsToGuess: Int = 4)_ (1 point): The main game loop that handles user input and game state. Make use of _generateRandomNonRepeatingNumber_ and _checkUserInputAgainstGeneratedNumber_ here. This function also utilizes a default argument 
- _generateRandomNonRepeatingNumber_ (1 point): A lambda expression that generates a random number with non-repeating digits of a specified length.
- _checkUserInputAgainstGeneratedNumber_ (1 point): A lambda expression that compares the user's input against the generated number and provides feedback.

``CompareResult.kt`` This class is a data structure which helps with bundling the result of the comparison of the user input and the generated number. Look at the toSting() and use it in your output.

Run the project with `./gradlew run` and test your implementation with the provided tests in `src/test/kotlin/AppTest.kt` with `./gradlew test`.

# Project Structure
The project is structured into two main Kotlin files:

**App.kt**: Contains the main game logic and functions.

**AppTest.kt**: Contains unit tests for the various functions in App.kt.
